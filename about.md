		<p style="font-size:0.9em;">I like to think that I’m a challenger by nature: eager to get to bottom of things, understand how they work, find loopholes in reasonings, try the new instead of sleeping on the old.</p>
		<p style="font-size:0.9em;">In late 2015 I discovered blockchain technologies while I was working as senior technologist at Repsol Technology Centre on singular and futuristic matters. I could never stop learning about it. It has been a Pandora’s box that will last a long time before I can get to the bottom of it. Wiser and brighter people came into my life and made me see the world differently.</p>
		<p style="font-size:0.9em;">I cofounded <a href="http://ethereummadrid.com">Ethereum Madrid</a> in 2016 as way to learn, meet new people and <a href="https://slides.com/donhylo">share knowledge</a>. In 2017 I started to go deeper in cryptoeconomics and in 2018, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandradataviz">Sandra Becker</a> and I we cofounded <a href="https://cryptoeconomics-hub.github.io">Cryptoeconomics.hub</a> to actively work and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/cryptoeconomics-hub/">bring people together</a> on what we believe is the most fundamental layer of logic of the blockchain space.</p>

		<p style="font-size:0.9em;">I'm currently leading the area of strategic technological prospective at Repsol's Technology and New Ventures Division. Previously I was in charge of the company’s department of singular projects and was also involved in R&D activities for the nuclear sector.</p>
    <p style="font-size:0.9em;">I'm passionate about complex issues and have thus always promoted multidisciplinary projects by following a win-win strategy. I'm fascinated about advances in knowledge of the human brain and the importance of an ever-conscious attention in the economy as a way to protect ourselves from big tech companies hijacking our minds.</p>
    <p style="font-size:0.9em;">The most complex project I'm currently undertaking is the raising of my daughter.</p>
